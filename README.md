# Senior Event Booking — Umbraco 13 CMS

A professional event booking MVP built on Umbraco 13 (.NET 8) with member-only bookings, a custom EventBookings table, Memberbase CRM integration, and a back-office Content App to view bookings per event.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers the requested MVP:

- Event management (Event document type) and event detail page
- Member-only booking form (Name, Email, optional Note)
- Persistence to a custom SQL table `EventBookings`
- Memberbase CRM integration (contact creation)
- Back-office Content App on Event nodes to view bookings (name, email, created date, CRM sync status)

## 📋 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [x] Event detail page with all fields (Title, Summary, Date/Time, Location, Capacity)
- [x] Member authentication and inline login on the event page
- [x] Booking form (Name, Email, Note) with server-side validation
- [x] Database persistence to `EventBookings`
- [x] Memberbase CRM API integration (contact creation) with robust logging
- [x] Back-office Content App tab: “Bookings” per Event
- [x] Success/error feedback displayed to the user after booking
- [ ] Event list (parent “EventList” doc type and listing template) — see “Status vs Brief”

### 🎨 User Interface
- Modern, clean design with professional aesthetics
- Color-coded badges for event status (Available, Selling Fast, Sold Out)
- SVG icon library for visual clarity
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive layout

### 🔒 Security Features
- Member authentication required for bookings
- Server-side input validation
- SQL injection protection via Entity Framework
- Secure API communication

Note: During development, anti-forgery validation was temporarily disabled on the booking POST action to eliminate 400 errors caused by cookie/header size and cert issues. See “Hardening” below for how to re-enable.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Components

#### **Models**
- `EventBooking.cs` - Entity model for booking data
- `BookingFormViewModel.cs` - Form validation model

#### **Data Layer**
- `EventBookingDbContext.cs` - EF Core database context
- Umbraco migration system for schema management
- SQL Server database with indexed columns

#### **Services**
- `IMemberbaseService.cs` - CRM integration interface
- `MemberbaseService.cs` - HTTP client-based API service with error handling

#### **Controllers**
- `BookingController.cs` - Surface controller handling form submissions
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- TempData for user feedback
 - Development note: `[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]` is currently applied; see “Hardening”.

### Frontend Components

#### **Views**
- `Event.cshtml` - Event detail page
- `_BookingForm.cshtml` - Booking form partial

Event listing page: A dedicated parent “EventList” doc type and listing template can be added if required by the reviewer (see “Status vs Brief” and “How to create content”).

#### **Styling**
- Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Responsive grid layouts
- Component-based styling approach

### Database Schema

**EventBookings Table:**
```sql
- Id (INT, Primary Key, Identity)
- EventKey (GUID, Indexed) - Links to Umbraco content node
- BookerName (NVARCHAR(200), Required)
- BookerEmail (NVARCHAR(255), Required, Indexed)
- Note (NVARCHAR(1000), Optional)
- CreatedDate (DATETIME, Required, Indexed, Default: GETUTCDATE())
- ApiContactId (NVARCHAR(200), Optional)
- ApiResponse (NVARCHAR(MAX), Optional)
- ApiSuccess (BIT, Required, Default: 0)
```

## 🔗 API Integration

### Memberbase CRM
- **Base URL**: `https://demo-log.memberbase-sandbox.com`
- **Endpoint(s)**: The service auto-detects and tries `/api/contacts` first and falls back to `/contacts` on 404.
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (JWT)
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**: `{ name, email, source }`

#### Integration Flow:
1. User submits booking form
2. Validation performed server-side
3. Booking saved to local database
4. Async API call to Memberbase
5. API response stored with booking record
6. User receives confirmation message

## 📦 Dependencies

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Umbraco.Cms" Version="13.9.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="8.0.11" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools" Version="8.0.11" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common" Version="4.10.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp" Version="4.10.0" />
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Database Connection
Located in `appsettings.Development.json`:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "umbracoDbDSN": "Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=Umbraco;...",
  "EventBookingDb": "Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=Umbraco;..."
}
```

### Memberbase API
```json
"Memberbase": {
  "BaseUrl": "https://demo-log.memberbase-sandbox.com",
  "ApiKey": "[JWT Token]"
}
```

The service configures an HttpClient with `BaseUrl` and the `Authorization: Bearer {ApiKey}` header. Full URLs are logged for troubleshooting.

## 📝 Creating Content

### Event Document Type (already in project)
- Alias: `Event`
- Template: `Event`
- Properties: Title (node name), Summary (RTE), EventDateTime (Date/Time), Location (Text), Capacity (Integer)

### EventList (optional for the MVP)
If the reviewer wants a dedicated container/listing page:
- Alias: `EventList`
- Template: `EventList`
- Allowed child types: `Event`
- Create 3+ child Event nodes under the `EventList` container.

### Creating an Event
1. In Back office → Content → Create → Event
2. Fill Title, Summary, Date/Time, Location, Capacity
3. Publish
4. Front-end URL: navigate to the Event’s URL from the back office “Info” tab.
## ▶️ Booking Flow (front-end)

1. Navigate to an Event’s front-end URL.
2. If not logged in as a member, use the inline login form on the page.
   - Create a test member in Back office → Members (choose a password and remember the username).
3. Fill in Name, Email, optional Note, and submit.
4. You’ll see a success message. If CRM sync fails, the booking still saves locally and shows a friendly message.

Where it persists: `EventBookings` table in SQL Server.
## 🗂️ Back office — Bookings tab (Content App)

On an Event node, a “Bookings” tab shows:

- ID, Booker Name, Email (mailto link)
- Booked On (UTC → shown as your browser locale)
- CRM Status (Synced / Failed)
- Note (first 30 chars)

If you just added the plugin, hard refresh the back office (Ctrl+F5). The tab fetches data from:
`/umbraco/surface/booking/geteventbookings?eventKey={eventGuid}`

## 🎯 Operational Excellence (OpEx) Compliance

This project demonstrates adherence to operational excellence principles:

### 1. **Standardization**
- Consistent naming conventions across all code
- Structured folder organization (Models, Services, Controllers, Data)
- Standard Umbraco architectural patterns followed
- Uniform code formatting and style

### 2. **Documentation**
- Comprehensive XML comments on all classes and methods
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- Commit messages following conventional commits format

### 3. **Error Handling & Logging**
```csharp
// Example from MemberbaseService.cs
try {
    _logger.LogInformation("Creating contact...");
    // API call logic
} catch (HttpRequestException ex) {
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Network error");
    return (false, null, "Network error message");
}
```

### 4. **Scalability & Maintainability**
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Interface-based service layer
- Separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
- Entity Framework for database abstraction

### 5. **Security Best Practices**
- Parameterized queries via EF Core
- Member authentication checks
- Input validation at multiple levels

Hardening to consider:
- Re-enable anti-forgery validation on the booking POST (remove `[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]` in `BookingController` and keep `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` in the view).
- Trust local HTTPS dev cert or continue using HTTP in dev to avoid 400s from cert/header issues.
